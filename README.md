## Project Requirements

- [x] Ask user for first name, then create a user name by moving the first letter to the end and adding ay
- [x] Read in from a file containg 5 questions with each question having 4 answers, 1 of which was correct
- [x] Loop through all the questions and answers
- [x] If a user guessed correctly, add 1 to their score
- [x] If user's score equaled a perfect score of 5, congratulate them

**The project is due October 22.**

## Update 10/16/201
I was able to refactor the quiz portion into one loop, instead of four seperate loops
I also added the userName  

## Features still need to be worked on:
Although, it now meets the project requirements, I need to come up with output statements for lower scores instead of just printing the score.
